# Soybean-Statistics
Finding solid, up-to-date statistics for soybeans is surprisingly difficult. Statistics like "98% of soybeans are converted into soybean meal" are thrown around with flimsy citations. Here I hope to share as many solid resources about soybean statistics as I can find.


* The [USDA-ERS](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/soybeans-oil-crops/related-data-statistics/) has a great website that goes into siginificant technical detail about soybean production, yield, prices, etc. and compares it to other major soybean-producing nations. Only problem is that they don't have easily readable figures. The [Oil Crops Outlook page](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/#!topicid=&subtopicid=&series=OCS&authorid=&page=1&sortfield=date&sortascending=false) is perhaps the best resource for comparing production between the top-producing countries; [here](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/5x21tf41f?locale=en) is the dataset.

* [FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#search/soybean) is another good resource (definitely easier to navigate than the USDA) for soybean data. Just like the USDA-ERS, however, they don't have great figures. But they do have more accessible datasets, so it shouldn't be too much to make a graph (WILL TRY TO MAKE ONE LATER)

* Supposedly [SOPA](http://www.sopa.org/statistics/world-soybean-production/) takes the USDA-ERS information and makes them more readbale. However, I have not double-checked this.

* The [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/soybean-reports.html) has quite a few graphs going into detail about the production of soybean. However, they're not indicating the datasets, or at least not at first glance. The graphs come from a group called the Hightower Report.
