# Soybean-Statistics
Finding solid, up-to-date statistics for soybeans is surprisingly difficult. Statistics like "98% of soybeans are converted into soybean meal" are thrown around with flimsy citations. Here I hope to share as many solid resources about soybean statistics as I can find.


* The [USDA-ERS](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/soybeans-oil-crops/related-data-statistics/) has a great website that goes into siginificant technical detail about soybean production, yield, prices, etc. and compares it to other major soybean-producing nations. Only problem is that they don't have easily readable figures. The [Oil Crops Outlook page](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/#!topicid=&subtopicid=&series=OCS&authorid=&page=1&sortfield=date&sortascending=false) is perhaps the best resource for comparing production between the top-producing countries; [here](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/5x21tf41f?locale=en) is the dataset.

* [FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#search/soybean) is another good resource (definitely easier to navigate than the USDA) for soybean data. Just like the USDA-ERS, however, they don't have great figures. But they do have more accessible datasets, so it shouldn't be too much to make a graph (WILL TRY TO MAKE ONE LATER)

* Supposedly [SOPA](http://www.sopa.org/statistics/world-soybean-production/) takes the USDA-ERS information and makes them more readable. However, I have not double-checked this.

* The [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/soybean-reports.html) has quite a few graphs going into detail about the production of soybean. However, they're not indicating the datasets, or at least not at first glance. The graphs come from a group called the Hightower Report.

* The [2020 Agricultural Export Yearbook by the USDA-FAS](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/2020-agricultural-export-yearbook) goes into detail about the export markets for U.S. soybeans.

Currently trying to find information about the percentage of soybeans processed into either meal or oil and whether they end up going into human consumption, animal feed, or industry.

* The [Oilseeds: World Markets and Trade](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/oilseeds-world-markets-and-trade) report by the USDA-FAS finally go into explicit detail about the proportions of soybeans (meal, crush, etc).
* Pages 21-31 of the May 2021 report go into quantitative detail (where you can get the data to make better graphs from, frankly) about worldwide soybean production.
